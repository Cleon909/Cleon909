PLACE HOLDER

I'm a beginner in tech with a background in Foreign Exchange and Investment Banking. I'm currently working through a QA Dev Ops bootcamp which will hopefully give me some basic skills in:
  - Python
  - Jenkins
  - CI/CD
  - Azure
  - Linux
  - Docker
 
 I'm interested in coding and hoping to start a career in tech after this course.
