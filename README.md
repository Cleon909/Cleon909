I'm a beginner in tech with a background in Foreign Exchange and Investment Banking. I've just completed a QA Dev Ops bootcamp which has given me some basic skills in:
  - Python
  - Jenkins
  - CI/CD
  - Azure
  - Linux
  - Docker
 
 I'm interested in coding and hoping to pursue either a career or a hobby in tech.
